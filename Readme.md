# Sales Funnel Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Sales Funnel Analytics** project aims to provide a structured, data-driven solution for monitoring and optimizing the lead-to-deal conversion process. By integrating CRM data, the project will enable the sales team to gain clear visibility into funnel performance, identify inefficiencies, and make informed decisions that drive higher conversion rates and shorter sales cycles.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Map the **lead-to-deal sales funnel**
- Track and visualize **funnel performance metrics**
- Identify **bottlenecks, drop-off points, and performance variances**
- Automate **sales reporting** for business stakeholders
- Generate **actionable recommendations** for improving conversions

---

## 🗂️ Funnel Stages
The sales funnel will be tracked through the following stages:

1. **Lead** – Raw prospect entry into CRM  
2. **Contacted** – Sales team initiates contact  
3. **Demo** – Product demonstration scheduled or completed  
4. **Proposal** – Commercial proposal shared with lead  
5. **Deal/Lost** – Final outcome recorded (won or lost)  

---

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **CRM Data Integration** – Connects with CRM (e.g., HubSpot export, CSV files)  
- **Funnel Visualization** – Provides insights into stage-level performance  
- **Drop-off Analysis** – Detects high-loss stages and areas for improvement  
- **Automated Reporting** – Delivers dashboards and reports to stakeholders  
- **Actionable Insights** – Recommends strategies for better conversion  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Google Sheets** – Initial data staging  
- **Google App Script** – Data ingestion automation  
- **CRM Export (CSV/HubSpot)** – Source data  
- *(Future)* BI Tools (Looker, Power BI, Tableau) for dashboards  

---

## 📌 Expected Outcomes
